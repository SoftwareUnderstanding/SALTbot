available in Pypi!](https://pypi.org/project/somef/). To install it just type:\n\n```\npip install somef\n```\n\n## Install from GitHub\nTo run SOMEF, please follow the next steps:\n\nClone this GitHub repository\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef.git\n```\n\nInstall somef (you should be in the folder that you just cloned). Note that for Python 3.7 and 3.8 the module Cython should be installed in advanced (through the command: `pip install Cython`).\n\n```\ncd somef\npip install -e .\n```\n\nRun SOMEF\n\n```bash\nsomef --help\n```\n\nIf everything goes fine, you should see:\n\n```bash\nUsage: somef [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help  Show this message and exit.\n\nCommands:\n  configure  Configure credentials\n  describe   Running the Command Line Interface\n  version    Show somef version.\n```\n\n\n<!--## Install from Pypi \nJust type:\n\n```bash\npip install somef\n```\n\n!!! info\n    Feature under development\n-->\n\n## Installing Through Docker\nWe provide a Docker image with SOMEF already installed. To run through Docker, you may build the Dockerfile provided in the repository by running:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t somef .\n```\nOr just use the Docker image already built in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kcapd/somef):\n\n```bash\ndocker pull kcapd/somef\n```\n\nThen, to run your image just type:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it kcapd/somef /bin/bash\n```\n\nAnd you will be ready to use SOMEF (see section below). If you want to have access to the results we recommend [mounting a volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/). For example, the following command will mount the current directory as the `out` folder in the Docker image:\n\n```bash \ndocker run -it --rm -v $PWD/:/out kcapd/somef /bin/bash\n```\nIf you move any files produced by somef into `/out`, then you will be able to see them in your current directory.\n\n## Configure\nBefore running SOMEF, you must configure it appropriately. Run:\n\n```bash\npython -m nltk.downloader wordnet\npython -m nltk.downloader omw-1.4\n```\nTo download two wordnet modules needed. Then run:\n\n```bash\nsomef configure\n```\n\nAnd you will be asked to provide the following: \n\n- A GitHub authentication token [**optional, leave blank if not used**], which SOMEF uses to retrieve metadata from GitHub. If you don't include an authentication token, you can still use SOMEF. However, you may be limited to a series of requests per hour.
